# NFT-Game

An QuizGame that rewards users with NFT.
The main purpose is to serve as an accessible onboarding into the world of web3.
Games are things people love, Quizzes much more.

My ideas was to merge all of that together with the concepts of NFTS.
You win the Game successfully, you get some nice NFTS which gives you ownership.

Built with:
1. `NEXTJS`
2. `RainbowKit SDK`
3. `ThirdWeb TS SDK`
4. `PolyGon`
5. `ChainLink VRF`
